  "submissionId": "CC-1745728838727-1745730841567",
  "strengths": [
    "The README is well-structured and clearly outlines the project's components and deployment steps.",
    "The project demonstrates an understanding of the overall architecture required for the challenge.",
    "The simulated structure reflects a modular approach to Terraform, which is good practice."
  ],
  "weaknesses": [
    "The submission is entirely placeholder content.  This makes it impossible to assess the actual implementation.",
    "No actual code or configuration files are provided.  The challenge requires functional code, not just a plan.",
    "The \"simulated\" steps are not a substitute for actual implementation and testing.  It's like handing in a blank exam and saying 'I understood the questions'.",
    "The lack of any actual code or configuration severely limits the assessment of security best practices and scalability implementation."
  ],
  "suggestions": [
    "Replace the placeholder files with actual working Terraform configurations and Node.js application code.",
    "Implement robust error handling and logging in your application and infrastructure.",
    "Test your implementation thoroughly before submission.  Don't just assume things will work.",
    "Focus on writing clean, well-documented, and efficient code.  Readability counts, especially in infrastructure-as-code.",
    "Demonstrate the application's scalability by testing with increased load. Don't just *claim* it's scalable."
  ],
  "improvementPath": "Complete the actual implementation, including working code, configuration files, and thorough testing, focusing on security best practices and scalability verification.",

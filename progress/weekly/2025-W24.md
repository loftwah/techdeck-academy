This week marked [Student Name/ID]'s first engagement with the platform.  While the initial project, a secure and scalable web app deployment, showed a strong understanding of the architectural design in the project plan, the submission lacked actual code and implementation.  This highlights a need to focus on translating theoretical knowledge into practical application.  Future efforts should prioritize completing coding challenges and submitting functional code, incorporating robust error handling and testing. The student has expressed clear learning goals and possesses strong foundational skills in AWS, Terraform, Kubernetes, CI/CD, security, and scaling, indicating a promising trajectory.  The upcoming week should concentrate on completing coding exercises and gaining hands-on experience to bridge the gap between conceptual understanding and practical implementation.

This week marked [Student Name/ID]'s initial engagement with the platform.  While a strong foundational understanding of AWS, Terraform, Kubernetes, CI/CD, security, and scaling was noted,  the first submitted project (a scalable web app deployment) lacked functional code and configuration files, preventing a proper assessment of practical skills.  The project plan demonstrated good architectural understanding, however.  The upcoming week should focus on translating theoretical knowledge into practical implementation, specifically completing coding and infrastructure-as-code challenges with a strong emphasis on testing and proper error handling.  We will work on ensuring submitted work reflects actual implementation and not just planned designs.  Consistent effort and attention to detail will lead to significant progress.

This week marked [Student Name/ID]'s first active engagement.  While a submitted project (Terraform/Kubernetes deployment) showed a strong understanding of the overall architecture and project planning, the actual implementation was missing. This resulted in an incomplete assessment.  The student demonstrated promising foundational knowledge in AWS, Terraform, Kubernetes, and CI/CD, as highlighted in their introductory letter.  The upcoming week should focus on completing the coding and configuration aspects of projects to demonstrate practical skills and achieve a functional deployment.  We will prioritize hands-on exercises to reinforce these concepts, and emphasize the importance of thorough testing and code documentation.  The goal is to move beyond conceptual understanding and showcase proficiency in building and deploying secure and scalable applications.

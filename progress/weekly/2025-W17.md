This week marked [Student Name/ID]'s first active engagement.  While the initial attempt at the "Secure and Scalable Web App Deployment" project demonstrated a good understanding of the overall architecture and project structure, the submission lacked functional code and configuration files.  This highlights a need to focus on translating theoretical knowledge into practical implementation.  Moving forward, the emphasis will be on completing coding and IaC challenges, ensuring all submitted work includes functional code and thorough testing.  We will prioritize building practical skills in Terraform, Kubernetes, and secure coding practices.  The student's stated learning goals and strong foundational knowledge provide a solid base for rapid progress in the coming weeks.

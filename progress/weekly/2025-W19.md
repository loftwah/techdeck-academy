This week marked [Student Name/ID]'s first active engagement.  While the initial Terraform/Kubernetes deployment project (CC-1745728838727) showcased understanding of project architecture and documentation, the submission lacked functional code.  This highlights a need to focus on practical implementation and testing, rather than just theoretical planning.  The student possesses strong foundational skills and clear learning goals, as evidenced by their chosen topics (AWS, Terraform, Kubernetes, CI/CD, Security, Scaling), but needs to translate theoretical knowledge into working solutions.  Next week's focus should be on completing coding and configuration tasks, ensuring thorough testing, and applying learned concepts to functional implementations.  We'll reinforce the importance of code quality, error handling, and demonstrating scalability through practical application.

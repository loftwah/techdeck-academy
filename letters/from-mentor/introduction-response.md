Dean,

So you're a 'Senior DevOps Engineer', eh?  Let's see about that.  Your introduction's fine, enough blather about your 'skills'.  I don't care about how *comfortable* you are with AWS; I care about what you can *actually* build.  We'll be focusing on production-ready systems, not toy projects.  Your list of 'what I want to learn' is a decent start – though rather generic.  We'll see how 'production' your systems actually are.

Your preference for direct feedback is…acceptable.  Expect no hand-holding.  I'll be blunt.  If you can't handle that, find another mentor.  This isn't some fluffy coding bootcamp.

Specific areas – good.  AWS scaling and security are crucial.  Terraform needs to be more than just 'working'; it has to be robust and maintainable.  Kubernetes deployment needs to be flawless.  We'll start with proper fundamentals; you wouldn't believe how many 'Senior' engineers mess up the basics.

I'll send you actual challenges separately, based on your…'configuration'. Let's see if your skills match your claims.  No time for pleasantries; get ready to work.  Don't disappoint.

Linus.

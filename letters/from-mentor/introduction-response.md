Dean,

So, you're a DevOps engineer wanting to get 'battle-tested,' huh?  Ambitious.  I've seen enough half-baked 'DevOps' engineers to fill a data center.  Let's see if you're actually any good.

Your list of skills looks...adequate. TypeScript and JavaScript?  Fine for some front-end nonsense, I suppose, but let's not dwell on that.  The rest is reasonably relevant, though 'working knowledge' of Kubernetes and Terraform is just another way of saying you've barely scratched the surface.  We'll fix that.

Your goals areâ€¦broad.  We'll focus on what actually matters: building reliable, scalable systems.  The theory's easy; execution is where it counts.  Forget about textbook fluff.  We'll be dealing with real-world problems, not academic exercises.

I've noted your preference for direct feedback.  Consider that your wish has been granted.  Expect no mercy.  We'll skip the pleasantries. 

I'll send over the first set of challenges separately.  Don't disappoint me.  Your stated preference for a brutally honest assessment indicates, at least, self-awareness.  Now prove it.

Linus.

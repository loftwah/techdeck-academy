So, Dean.  Senior DevOps Engineer, huh?  Let's see if that's actually true.  Your list of skills looks…familiar.  Nothing particularly groundbreaking, but it's a start.  You want production systems, clean Terraform, Kubernetes clusters that don't spontaneously combust, secure AWS, and reliable CI/CD.  Ambitious.  We'll see.  Don't expect hand-holding.  This isn't some university course.  I'll be brutally honest.  Expect direct feedback; if your code is crap, I'll tell you it's crap.  I'm not here to inflate egos.  Your stated preferences for learning are…acceptable.  We'll dispense with the pleasantries.  I'll send you some actual challenges separately, based on your… ‘preferences.’  Let's see if you can actually handle them. Don't waste my time.

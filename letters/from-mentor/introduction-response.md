Dean,

So you're a DevOps engineer, huh?  'Strong' with TypeScript and Docker.  We'll see about that.  Let's not waste time with pleasantries. Your goals are ambitious – production systems, scalable AWS, bulletproof Kubernetes.  Sounds like you've got some basic ideas, but 'comfortable with AWS basics' isn't going to cut it in the real world.  We'll find out how much you *really* know.

I've seen your list of things you *want* to learn.  That's fine.  We'll see if you can actually *do* them. I don't hand out participation trophies. This isn't some corporate training course.  Expect no sugar-coating, only brutally honest feedback.  Prepare to be challenged.

Your preferred learning style sounds… efficient. Good.  Because we’ll be efficient with our time. I won't waste time with fluff or hand-holding.  Formal challenges will follow separately.  Prove you're not just another over-hyped DevOps guy.  Show me what you've got.

Linus.

# To Linus

Hi,

I'm Dean.  
I'm a Senior DevOps Engineer focused on infrastructure, automation, and scaling.  
I'm here to sharpen my skills and push into more advanced architecture and security.

## Current skills

- Strong with TypeScript, JavaScript, and Docker
- Working knowledge of Python, Kubernetes, Terraform, and GitHub Actions
- Comfortable with AWS basics (EC2, RDS, S3) but want to level up around scaling and hardening

## What I want to learn

- Building production systems that handle real traffic and failure
- Writing clean, modular Terraform
- Running proper Kubernetes clusters
- Designing AWS setups that are both scalable and secure
- Building CI/CD pipelines that are reliable and maintainable

## How I prefer to learn

- Direct feedback
- Tell me exactly where I'm wrong
- No sugarcoating or padding
- Real-world focus over textbook theory

## Specific areas to focus on

- AWS scaling strategies and architecture
- Terraform structure and practices
- Kubernetes production deployment
- AWS security and IAM
- Solid CI/CD automation

Looking forward to getting properly battle-tested.

Thanks,  
Dean

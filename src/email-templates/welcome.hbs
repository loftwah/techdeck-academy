<h1>Welcome to TechDeck Academy!</h1>

<p>I'll be your {{mentor.name}} mentor for your journey in learning {{learningTopics}}.</p>

<h2>How This Works</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Challenges:</strong> Based on your configuration, you'll receive challenges {{scheduleDescription}}.</li>
  <li><strong>Submissions:</strong> When you complete a challenge, create a directory for your solution within the `submissions/` folder (e.g., `submissions/CC-123/`). Place all your solution files inside this directory and commit/push.</li>
  <li><strong>Feedback:</strong> After you submit, I'll review your work and provide feedback based on my teaching style ({{mentor.name}}, {{mentor.tone}}) and your progress.</li>
  <li><strong>Questions:</strong> If you have questions, place a markdown file in the <code>letters/to-mentor/</code> directory. I'll respond promptly.</li>

# TechDeck Academy

![TechDeck Academy Logo](src/assets/techdeck-academy.jpg)

Welcome to the open-source version of **TechDeck Academy**! This project provides a framework for an AI-powered, personalized learning experience driven by GitHub Actions and powered by Google Gemini. It's designed to help users learn technical subjects through AI-generated challenges, feedback, Q&A, and progress tracking.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **AI-Generated Challenges:** Automatically creates coding or technical challenges based on user configuration (`config.ts`) and AI context (`ai-memory.md`). Ensures challenges are relevant and avoid immediate repetition.
*   **Personalized Feedback:** AI analyzes submissions, providing qualitative feedback (strengths, weaknesses, suggestions) in Markdown format, guided by a chosen mentor persona and user history. AI is prompted to include a score justification within the text, but this score is not stored or processed by the application.
*   **AI Mentor Q&A:** Users ask questions via markdown files (`letters/to-mentor/`); AI responds based on persona and context, logging insights to `ai-memory.md`. AI is prompted to suggest config changes if appropriate.
*   **Automated Progress Tracking:** Generates narrative progress summaries (digests) based on `ai-memory.md`.
*   **User-Controlled Configuration:** `config.ts` is the single source of truth for user settings (topics, difficulty, schedule, mentor). The application syncs the profile to this config but does not automatically change difficulty/topic levels based on performance.
*   **GitHub-Based Workflow:** Leverages GitHub Actions for automation; Git stores state (profile, memory, challenges, etc.).
*   **State Management:** Uses `student-profile.json` for minimal essential state (status, completion count, last updated) and `ai-memory.md` for rich, dynamic AI context.
*   **Data Management:** Archives old interaction files.

## ⚙️ How It Works

TechDeck Academy operates primarily through a set of GitHub Actions:

1.  **Configuration (`config.ts`):** User defines preferences (topics, levels, difficulty, types), schedule, mentor. **This file is the source of truth for these settings.**
2.  **Profile Initialization/Sync (`loadOrCreateAndSyncProfile` in `profile-manager.ts`, called by workflows):** Reads `student-profile.json`. If non-existent, creates it using `config.ts` values (userId, name, difficulty -> currentSkillLevel, topics -> topicLevels, initial status based on `introductionSubmitted`). If exists, syncs `userId`, `name`, `topicLevels` from `config.ts`. **Does NOT auto-update `status` or `currentSkillLevel` from config after creation.**
3.  **Challenge Generation (`send-challenge.yml`):** Runs on schedule/manually. Checks if challenges exist (skips if yes). If user profile `status` is `'active'` (or `introductionSubmitted` is true), calls `ai.generateChallenge`. This function:
    *   Prompts AI for **Markdown** challenge content (Title, Description, Topics, Requirements, Examples, Hints) based on config and AI memory.
    *   Parses the AI's Markdown response locally.
    *   Adds locally generated `id`, `createdAt`, and locally determined `type` and `difficulty` (from config).
    *   Validates and saves the complete challenge object as a `.json` file in `challenges/`.
    *   Sends email notification.
4.  **Submission Processing (`process-submissions.yml`):** Triggered by push changes within subdirectories of `submissions/`. Detects the changed directory, reads its contents, and calls `ai.generateFeedback`. This function:
    *   Prompts AI for **Markdown** feedback (Strengths, Weaknesses, Suggestions, Improvement Path), asking it to include score/justification *in the text* and suggest config review if needed.
    *   Parses the AI's Markdown response locally, **ignoring any score text.**
    *   Creates a `Feedback` object (no `score` field) with local `submissionId`, `createdAt` and parsed qualitative fields.
    *   Saves feedback as `.json` in `feedback/`.
    *   Updates `student-profile.json` (increments `completedChallenges`, updates `lastUpdated`, **no score processing**).
    *   Updates `ai-memory.md` with a qualitative summary.
    *   Sends feedback email.
5.  **Letter Processing (`respond-to-letters.yml`):** Triggered by push to `letters/to-mentor/`. Uses AI to generate response (JSON format for `LetterResponse` including `content` and `insights`), logs insights to `ai-memory.md`, emails `content`, archives letter. **If first letter & `introductionSubmitted` is false, updates profile `status` to `'active'`, enabling challenges.** Also prompts AI to suggest config review if appropriate.
6.  **Digest Generation (`generate-digests.yml`):** Runs on schedule. Uses AI to generate a *narrative summary* of the entire `ai-memory.md` for the period (weekly/monthly/quarterly). Saves to `progress/`.
7.  **File Rotation (`rotate-files.yml`):** Periodically archives old challenges, submissions, feedback based on `config.ts`.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1.  **Fork & Clone:** Fork to your GitHub, then clone your fork.
2.  **Install:** `npm install`
3.  **API Keys:** Create `.env` with `GEMINI_API_KEY` and `RESEND_API_KEY`. **Crucially, also add these as GitHub Secrets in your repo settings.**
4.  **Customize `config.ts`:** Set `userEmail`, `githubUsername`, `topics` & `currentLevel`, `difficulty`, `mentorProfile`, etc. Decide on `introductionSubmitted` (default `false` recommended).
5.  **First Letter (if `introductionSubmitted: false`):** Create `.md` file in `letters/to-mentor/` with intro/goals. Commit & push. (This activates challenge generation).
6.  **Submit Challenge:** Once you receive a challenge, create a directory in `submissions/` named after the challenge ID (e.g., `submissions/CC-123/`). Place your solution files inside this directory. Commit & push.
7.  **Commit & Push Config:** Commit `config.ts` (and `.gitignore` if `.env` added). Push.
8.  **Enable & Understand Actions:** Check Actions tab. `send-challenge.yml` needs `status: 'active'` (set after first letter OR via `introductionSubmitted: true`). `process-submissions.yml` triggers **only** on pushes to the `main` branch affecting `submissions/**`. Use `workflow_dispatch` for manual runs if needed.

## Important: Submission Workflow using Branches

To ensure your submission is only processed when it's complete, follow these steps precisely:

1.  **Why:** The `process-submissions` workflow automatically starts grading your submission *immediately* when changes are detected in the `submissions/` directory **on the `main` branch**. Pushing incomplete work directly to `main` will result in that incomplete work being graded.

2.  **Recommended Workflow:**
    *   Always start by ensuring your local `main` branch is up-to-date:
      ```bash
      git checkout main
      git pull origin main
      ```
    *   Create a dedicated branch for your submission. Replace `CHALLENGE_ID` with the actual ID (e.g., `CC-123`):
      ```bash
      git checkout -b submit-CHALLENGE_ID 
      ```
    *   Work on your solution files within the correct submission directory (e.g., `submissions/CHALLENGE_ID/`).
    *   Commit your changes frequently on your feature branch:
      ```bash
      # Make changes...
      git add submissions/CHALLENGE_ID/
      git commit -m "Work on submission CHALLENGE_ID - detail of changes"
      ```
    *   (Optional but recommended) Push your branch to GitHub for backup:
      ```bash
      git push -u origin submit-CHALLENGE_ID
      ```
    *   Repeat the editing, adding, and committing steps until your submission is fully complete.

3.  **Submitting Your Work:** Only when your submission is 100% ready for grading:
    *   Switch back to the `main` branch:
      ```bash
      git checkout main
      ```
    *   Ensure `main` is still up-to-date:
      ```bash
      git pull origin main
      ```
    *   Merge your completed feature branch into `main`:
      ```bash
      git merge submit-CHALLENGE_ID
      ```
      *(Handle any merge conflicts if they occur.)*
    *   Push the `main` branch to GitHub. This push will trigger the grading workflow:
      ```bash
      git push origin main
      ```

## 🔄 Resetting Your Progress

To reset (delete state files), use:

```bash
npm run reset
```
**Then commit and push the deletions.** This clears `student-profile.json`, `ai-memory.md`, `challenges/`, directories within `submissions/`, `feedback/`, `letters/`, `progress/`, `archive/`. You'll need to restart the introduction flow (submit first letter or set config flag) to get challenges again.
